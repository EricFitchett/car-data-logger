[ ] Proper CLI for decode-app
[ ]   Maven goals for each app?
[ ] GUI for decode-app
[ ] Progress bars for decode-app GUI
[ ]   Line number callback for decoder
[ ] Move jspf from parent to plugin (or create separate module)
[ ] Remove jspf dependency added to all projects
[ ] Exception Logging (especially for plugins)
[ ] Device aliases during capture (add these to the data so they can be separated later, for GPS1, GPS2, etc)
[ ] Application to re-sync devices
[ ]   Manually
[ ]   Auto re-sync GPS to car data based on initial entry with non-zero speed

[ ] Create new data processors:
[ ]   Accelerometer (convert to Gs)
[ ]   Empty field removal
[X]   GPS Lap Counter (also adds lap time) - parameters: lat/long for both ends of finish line, or track file
[ ]   Unit conversion?  (GPS meters altitude to feet, allow user configurable conversions matching on unit, with JavaScript calculation like CAN decoder)
[ ]   Create AbstractDataProcessor to handle proper null implementation of getAdditionalParameters

[ ] Create new decoders:
[ ]   Accelerometer / Gyro
[X]   GPS

[ ] New apps:
[/]   Track image creator
[ ]     Add finish line
[ ]     Add preferred rotation
[ ]     Read from config file
[ ]   Data visualizer (output data on series of transparent pngs, for video overlay)
[X]     Use multiple cpu cores for speedup
[ ]       Allow thread number to be configurable (with an autodetect option as default)
[ ]         Can we autodetect hyperthreading, so a dual-core cpu with hyperthreading will give 2 threads, not 4?  Look into performance implications.
[ ]     Use video card for speedup?  Look into rootbeer project (http://chirrup.org/rootbeer/ / https://github.com/pcpratts/rootbeer1/)
[ ]     Gauges:
[ ]       Bar Gauge
[X]         Basic functionality
[ ]         Labels
[ ]         SVG frame?
            * Should SVG frame be in a base gauge class, so its functionality is available to all gauges?
[/]       RX-8 Style Speedometer/Tachometer
[X]       Threshold Image (E-Brake Light)
[X]       Rotated Image (Steering Wheel)
[/]       Text (current lap, lap time, etc)
[X]         timeFormat config param for handling time display from milliseconds
[X]         emptyValueDisplay (to show "-" for empty values for lap counter, times, etc)
[ ]         font and size selection
[ ]         anti-aliasing
[/]       GPS Map
[/]         configure track
[X]         configure opacity
[/]         default to correct aspect ratio (but allow override)
[ ]         auto select track based on latitude/longitude?
